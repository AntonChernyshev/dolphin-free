Script for an infinite number of profiles for free Dolphin Anty

## **Setup:**
1. First you need to log in to your account in the Dolphin Anty program, or create a new one, since the old browser profiles will still not be visible. You need to make sure you have **at least 1 idle profile** in stock before the profile limit (9/10), otherwise the profiling won't work. Then we close the antidetect.
2. Copy the **app.asar** file from the files folder of the script and move it with a replacement to the folder with the installed antidetect \Dolphin Anty\resources. Most likely, you can find the desired antidetect folder in one of the following paths:
 - C:\Users\*your username*\AppData\Local\Programs\Dolphin Anty\resources
 - C:\Program Files\Dolphin Anty\resources
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. python main.py

## **Settings:**
You can open the **settings.py** file and set the **backup** variable to **True** or **False**. Each time the profile is successfully closed, it will be copied to the browsers_backup folder
